Failures in agricultural policies, weak institutions, and poor governance are the root of growth stagnation.""  “Low agricultural productivity results in rural poverty, food insecurity, malnutrition, limited economic growth and social problems.”  “Undernutrition imposes large economic and social costs, estimated at up to 16.5% of GDP in Africa.”  ""Undernutrition has immediate and long-term effects on physical growth and cognitive development that can reduce overall performance and GDP growth rate.""","“Key recommendations include investing in local institutions, nutrition interventions, agricultural R&D, risk management, water productivity, environmental sustainability, and coordinating multiple sectors.”  ""Develop and implement a strategy to strengthen local institutions that build human capital to advance food security.""  “Favorable policies like CAADP, infrastructure development, nutrition-sensitive agriculture, youth bulge, and growing food demand due to urbanization and income growth provide opportunities.”  ""In addition, African governments have committed, at least in theory, to allocate at least 10% of the national budget for agriculture.""",,,,,,
18,The Food Security Conundrum of sub-Saharan Africa,Ken E. Giller,,,,,"“A significant paradigm shift in policy and structural changes are suggested. This includes changes in the farming systems and the broader economy.”  ""Our analyses increasingly suggest that major structural change to the farming systems is needed... This further requires massive structural change outside agriculture, to encourage creation of rural and urban jobs, it needs industrialization to move along hand in hand with agriculture and other forms of social protection are required in the form of social safety nets.""","“The author acknowledges the complexity of the food security problem in sub-Saharan Africa, raising more questions than providing answers.”  ""In this discussion of food security in sub-Saharan Africa I raise more questions than I have answers. Yet if it was clear what needs to be done to address this ‘wicked problem’ – it would not be a conundrum!""",,"“The primary challenge discussed is the need to increase agricultural production in Africa to meet the demands of both national and international markets, especially given land fragmentation and low prices for produce.”  ""So agricultural production in Africa needs to increase strongly to meet the demands of both national and international markets.""","“The document references interactions with the Ethiopian Minister of Agriculture, suggesting a context-specific discussion related to Ethiopia.

60,"Who drives the digital revolution in agriculture? A review of supply-side trends, players, and challenges","Regina Birner, Thomas Daum, Carl Pray (2021)","The article indicates that the software solutions not linked to precision farming equipment, especially advisory apps and farm management software, require some form of hardware, such as smartphones or computers, to operate. In regions where such devices are not widespread, the market for these software products is limited. This can be seen as a barrier to adoption.
The demand for digital agricultural technologies is influenced by factors such as the level of mechanization, economies of scale at the farm level, input prices (including labor costs), output prices, and environmental regulations. These factors can either encourage or hinder the adoption rate of these technologies.
Pertinent quotes from the content include:
""In regions where such devices are not widespread, the market for the respective software products is, therefore, limited.""
""Since the precision farming technologies are embodied in agricultural machinery, their market size is determined by the level of mechanization across different regions of the world.""","Digital agriculture is paving the way for a transformative era in agricultural practices. At the forefront of this change are private firms, spanning established input firms to global software giants and budding startups.

""It fills a gap in literature as most studies do not look into the cumulative impact of different ICT-based interventions.""",,,"Indirect media like radio is useful for raising awareness about basic practices, while SMS or videos may be better for more complex messages.
Consider farmers' literacy, language, gender norms, costs and infrastructure when selecting dissemination channels.
Study complementarity of ICT and conventional extension approaches.","The study did not look at the long-term adoption or intensification of practices over time. ""We are therefore not considering the timing factor and therefore neither rate of adoption nor intensification of adoption.""",,"The use of radio and SMS improved farmers' awareness and adoption of legume-based sustainable agricultural intensification (SAI) practices and technologies. ""Both awareness and adoption are boosted if SMS supports radio campaigns."" This helped to scale up smallholder participation in SAI and could lead to increased productivity.","The study was conducted in Tanzania where average yields of crops like beans are low despite the availability of improved varieties and practices. Dissemination of agricultural information is constrained by limited reach of extension workers. ""Back in 2006, Tanzania was the second-largest producer of dry beans in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, the average yields are still below the potential.""","On average, 80% of farmers learned something new from the campaign. Awareness was highest for seed selection and planting practices.
